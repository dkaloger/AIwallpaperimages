To open the UI right click on the system tray item. [Instructions](https://github.com/dkaloger/WallpaperOS/wiki/Instructions)

Feel free to suggest a wallpaper on the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/WEQMuzeAk9) .

_Note: Moving the executable to a different directory will break autostart, to fix this just run the executable at its new location to update autostart. A cache folder , a settings file and an image of the current wallpaper are created at the executable directory so it is recommended to keep it in a folder._

_The images are stored on [Github](https://github.com/dkaloger/WallpaperOS/tree/main/Images/FLUX/Upscaled/upscayl_jpg_realesrgan-x4plus_3840px) and you can use them freely for anything_
